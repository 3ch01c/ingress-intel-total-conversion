<h3>Latest news</h3>

<h4>31st May 2014</h4>
<p>
IITC 0.17.1 and IITC Mobile 0.11.1 have just been released.
</p>
<p>
Another critical update, due to more changes by Niantic. Hopefully the last one for a while - all recent breaking changes
were caused by Niantic removing the obsfucation of data requests one bit at a time - the final piece has been removed now.
</p>
<p>
<b>Lost bookmarks? Drawn items?</b> In the latest Niantic site update they changed the server to always go to the
<code>http<b>s</b></code> version. It is possible to copy your data to the new location - further details

</p>
<p>
Additionally, a few bugs were fixed since the previous release, and now most map layers support zooming in closer than before.
<b>Note</b>: There can be issues on Chrome when zooming beyond zoom level 18 (the previous default maximum for several maps).
Just zoom out again if the zoom/layer controls, or the COMM panel, disappear.
</p>

<h4>24th May 2014</h4>
<p>
And another IITC update, IITC 0.16.12 and IITC Mobile 0.11.0 have just been released, to fix things after the most recent
update to the standard intel site.
</p>
<p>
Note that Niantich have trimmed down the data a bit more, removing things not used by the standard intel site. In particular,
we no longer know the resonator deployment distance, the portal address, and the portal description.
Due to this, the 'show-address' and 'draw-resonators' plugins are no longer available.
